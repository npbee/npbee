### ðŸ‘‹ Hi â€”

I'm a software engineer based in Portland, Oregon. I specialize in frontend development and enjoy component-based architecture, typography, and getting the details just right.

I write a lot of TypeScript and React with a dash of Svelte and Astro on the side. I love building delightful, practical, and accessible user experiences that help people get things done. 

I currently work as a software engineer at [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) building the [Forms](https://helloworks.com) application.
