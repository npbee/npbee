## ðŸ‘‹ Hi â€”

I'm **Nick Ball**, a web developer based out of Portland, OR. I specialize in frontend development and enjoy component-based architecture, typography, and getting the details just right.

I do a lot of coding in **React** and **TypeScipt**, but ultimately love delivering good user experiences with whatever tools I can. 

I currently work at @dropbox building the [HelloWorks](https://www.hellosign.com/products/helloworks) application.
